        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Carvajal-Carmona laboratory works on the genetics of human diseases using several approaches
including linkage analysis, candidate gene and genome-wide association studies, admixture mapping,
germline and tumor sequencing and a number of "omics" technologies. Our research studies are
highly collaborative and draw expertise from several fields including genetics, statistics, epidemiology,
bioinformatics and genomics. We collaborate with several groups in Europe, Asia and the Americas.
We are also establishing several local collaborations at <a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/cancer/">UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and the
<a href="http://biosci.ucdavis.edu/index_js.html">School of Biological Sciences.</a></p>

<p>The main focus of our studies has been human cancer. We have shown, in the past, the existence of several
risk alleles that increase the probability of cancer using genome-wide linkage and association studies using SNP-
array based designs. At UC Davis, we are continuing with these gene-hunting efforts and are primarily
using approaches based on next-generation sequencing, given the excellent facilities in our <a href="http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/">Genome Center</a> and in the <a href="http://research.ucdavis.edu/bgi">BGI@UCDavis Joint Sequencing Facility</a>.
Below, there is a brief description of our
main ongoing projects, most of which are in the need of enthusiastic graduate students and postdocs (<a href="opportunities.html">We
are hiring!</a>).</p><br>

<h2>Colorectal Cancer</h2>

<p>At our lab, we are currently working on building onto the largest resource used to study the genetics of colorectal cancer
in the Hispanic population. Colorectal cancer is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the country.
The risk of colorectal cancer is partially mediated by a genetic predisposition. It is hoped that once most of
the colorectal cancer
genes are identified, such information can be used to improve prevention and treatment. We have working
at the forefront of colorectal cancer genetics and have been involved in the discovery of nearly all SNPs
that increase the risk of this malignancy in the Caucasian population. At UC Davis, we are continuing
with our gene identification efforts, using samples from our studies in Latin America. Specifically, we are
sequencing whole exomes from early-onset cases from Hispanic isolates and from multi-case families that
do not have mutations in any of the known colorectal cancer genes. We also have an active participation
in the CHIBCHA study, the largest admixture mapping study that is being carried out in the Hispanic
population. In addition to gene identification efforts, we also have plans to investigate the function of CRC
alleles using expression quantitative mapping studies and other "omics" approaches.</p><br>

<h2>Breast Cancer</h2>

<p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and about a third of the risk is accounted by
genetic variation, most of which is still unknown. We are currently using genetics to identify novel causes
of breast cancer, investigate pharmacogenetic responses and address health disparities among various populations.
Interestingly, the risk of disease, as well as the way in
which cancer presents, varies between populations. For example, women from Hispanic populations from
the USA and Latin America tend to present with cancer at much earlier ages, suggesting the existence of
genetic elements that are involved in disease predisposition. Furthermore, breast cancers in Hispanics
are diagnosed at later stages, when compared to other ethnic groups, and generally have worse prognoses.
Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the risk of breast cancer in Hispanics is associated with a
higher European ancestry. Our group is currently engaged in similar studies in the Colombian population
and is aiming to identify breast cancer genes using admixture mapping. At UC Davis, we are also currently
planning to use next generation sequencing to identify new breast cancer genes in this population using
exome sequencing. We also have planned studies on pharmacogenetics of aromatase inhibitors (In
collaboration with Dr. Helen Chew at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center) and on functional
genomics and epidemiology of variation in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway.</p><br>

<h2>Thyroid Cancer</h2>

<p>Thyroid cancer, an epidemic and highly genetic malignancy, accounts for ~2% of all diagnosed cancers in the USA, is the most common endocrine
malignancy in the country, and its incidence is increasing at a very fast rate (4.5% per year). Thyroid cancer
is three times more common in women. In American women; thyroid cancer is the 6th most commonly
diagnosed malignancy (~50K new cases/year) and the 4th most prevalent cancer. About half a million
Americans have or have had thyroid cancer and therefore, this cancer is becoming an important public
health issue in the USA. Among common malignancies, thyroid cancer has the strongest familial risk
and thus is highly amenable for gene mapping studies. The identification of thyroid cancer genes will
be crucial to establish personalized medical programs and to discover pathways that can be targeted for
therapeutic development. One of the long-term aims of our research group will be to work in this unique
and promising cancer genetics research niche. We are currently planning to carry out the following studies
on this condition: i) Identification of susceptibility variants in thyroid stem cell genes using targeted
sequencing; ii) Investigation of associations between genetic ancestry and cancer risk in Hispanics using a
panel of ancestry informative markers and; iii) Identification of new high and moderate penetrance loci using
exome sequencing in familial cases.</p><br>

<h2>Gastric Cancer</h2>

<p>Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The incidence of gastric
cancer varies across populations, with the highest incidence reported in Asia, Latin America and in some
European countries such as Portugal. Our group currently has two main projects on gastric cancer genetics, focused
on identifying new familial forms of gastric cancer and sequencing tumors in Hispanic populations.
One of them is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Manuel Teixeira in the Portuguese Institute of
Oncology, and involves exome sequencing of index cases from 16 Portuguese families who do not have
<i>CDH1</i> mutation (the only known gastric cancer gene) but that appear to be segregating a monogenic form
of the disease. The second project is in collaboration with colleagues in Colombia and has initially a
dual purpose: i) to investigate associations between ancestry and cancer risk in Hispanics using ancestry
informative markers and; ii) to understand the patterns of somatic mutations in Hispanic gastric tumors
using exome sequencing. The No Stomach for Cancer foundation awarded a $50,000 grant to Dr.
Carvajal-Carmona for a study titled  'Gastric cancer gene identification through haplotype analysis and sequencing'.
Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths and approximately ~10% of cases show familial
clustering. So far, mutations in gene CDH1 are the only known cause of familial gastric cancer (Hereditary Diffuse
Gastric Cancer or HDGC), that explain only 25% of familial cases. Through this study we aim to identify missing
heritability in CDH1 negative familial gastric cancer cases by performing exome sequencing and identity-by-descent
analysis on cases recruited from population isolates in Portugal and Spain.</p><br>

<h2>Single Cell Sequencing</h2>

<p>Cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of subclonal populations at the genetic level that possess a selective
growth advantage over normal tissue. Furthermore, these subclones have differential responses to therapeutic interventions,
particularly molecularly targeted approaches to treatment. Traditional cancer genomics techniques obtain sequence data at
a single time point from bulk tumor tissue. This method provides a snapshot of somatic mutational profiles at the population
level, but is limited in its sensitivity to detect rare and potentially important subclones by sample quality, sequencing depth,
and subclonal population frequency. However, recent technological advances in the field of single cell genomics now allow for
the interrogation of genetic aberrations at a single cell resolution in a high throughput fashion, providing the technical means
to fully map the clonal architecture of solid tumors. Furthermore, the lack of temporal resolution makes the identification of
mutations that provide a selective growth advantage more challenging, hindering the search for driver mutations. Serial sampling
of single cells from a tumor over time and after therapeutic bottlenecks has the potential to provide important insights into
the molecular processes underlying cancer development as well as resistance to therapy. To this end, we perform exome sequencing
of single tumor cells isolated from patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to evaluate tumor heterogeneity before and after
therapy. The high genetic diversity may explain why this heterogeneous tumors can be so difficult to treat as each tumor can be
composed of many individual subclones that can become dominant under selective pressures, such as cytotoxic therapy, resulting
in relapse. </p><br>
