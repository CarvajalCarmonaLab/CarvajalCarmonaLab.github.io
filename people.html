			  <p class="lead2"> Nicole is a native of Pheonix, Arizona. She graduated from Denison University with a BS in Molecular and Cellular Biology, where she was also a student athlete on the Denison women's basketball team. At Davis she is part of the Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Phusiology graduate group with a Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology and an MCB T23 Training Grant Fellow. Nicole's project in the lab focuses on the identification of functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphism associated with increased risk for Colorectal Cancer that may play a role in the onset or progresison of the disease. Her project utilizes both bioinformatic tools as well as CRISPR genome editing technology. </p>
			  
			  <p class="lead2">Nicole continues to enjoy playing basketball while in Davis as well as developing her skills as a kick boxer. When she's not in the lab, Nicole can usually be found hiking trails around the bay area with her enthusiatic four-legged companion or discovering local culinary gems.</p>.
